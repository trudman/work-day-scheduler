# Work Day Scheduler

## Description

This project was my Work Day Scheduler project using javascript and jQuery. My motivation for this project was to familiarize myself with using API's like jquery to create an application. This project allowed me to continue to build on my javascript base and add in elements of jquery. This exercise again tested my ability to create an application through the use of breaking up the project into pieces in order to produce a full app. It was challenging to use different syntax in jquery. This project allowed me to feel more comfortable with javascript and the use of jquery.

Installation
NA

Usage
To use this scheduler the user can enter in their tasks for the corresponding blocks of time. Once the user clicks save, the information is saved into the local storage and persists on refresh of the page. The time blocks will change colors depending on the actual time. The past time blocks will show gray, present will show as red and future will show as green.
